# Read me file for Angular Banking Application Frontend

## Overview

This is an Angular application that serves as the frontend for a banking system. It communicates with the Spring Boot backend to provide a user interface for banking operations.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later
- Angular CLI 15 or later
- npm 9 or later

## Installation Instructions

1. Install Node.js and npm

To install Node.js and npm, you can follow these steps:

- For Ubuntu/Debian:
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

- For macOS using Homebrew:
  brew install node

- For Windows: Download the Node.js installer from the official Node.js website and run it. 
This will install both Node.js and npm.

2. Install Angular CLI
   npm install -g @angular/cli

3. Fetch the frontend codebase which I have shared via email

4. In the root folder of the frontend component, execute  npm install. This will install all the dependencies related for the project.

5. To run the application use this command 'ng serve' which allows you you to view the app on http://localhost:4200/

Note on Frontend Deployment: Since I was unable to deploy the frontend app using Nginx in Docker, I'm sharing this file 
so that one can execute it locally using above-mentioned steps.
